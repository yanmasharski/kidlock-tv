## 📖 About

**KidLock** is an Android TV application designed to help parents manage their children's screen time effectively. As a parent myself, I understand the challenges of balancing technology use with healthy development. Digital wellbeing is crucial in today's world, and I believe every family should have access to tools that help create a healthier relationship with screens.

That's why I'm making KidLock **open source and freely available to everyone**. This app is my contribution to helping families navigate the digital age together.

### Key Components

3. **PinInputActivity**: PIN authentication screen
4. **ScreenTimeAccessibilityService**: Background service for app monitoring and blocking
5. **DataRepository**: Centralized data management
6. **AppSettings**: Persistent settings storage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android TV device or emulator running Android 7.0 or higher
- Android Studio (for building from source)

### Installation (from source)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yanmasharski/kidlock-tv.git
   cd kidlock-tv
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Build and run on your Android TV device or emulator

### Installation (from APK)

If you just want to install the app without building it yourself, you can use the prebuilt APK:

1. Locate the release APK in this repository at `app/release/app-release.apk`
2. Copy the APK to your Android TV device (for example via USB drive, network share, or `adb`)
3. On your Android TV, enable installation from unknown sources in system settings (if not already enabled)
4. Open the APK on your TV (e.g. with a file manager) and confirm the installation
5. Once installed, you will find **KidLock** in your apps list on Android TV

### First-Time Setup

1. Launch KidLock on your Android TV
2. Grant required permissions:
   - **Accessibility Service**: Required for app blocking functionality
   - **Usage Stats**: Required for tracking app usage time
3. Set up your admin PIN (6 digits)
4. Configure time limits and access codes

## 🔒 Permissions

KidLock requires the following permissions:

- **BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE**: To detect when apps are launched and block them when necessary
- **PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS**: To monitor how long apps have been used
- **RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED**: To restart monitoring after device reboots

These permissions are essential for the app to function properly and are used solely for parental control purposes.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Set Time Limits**: Configure daily screen time limits through the admin panel
2. **Monitor Usage**: KidLock tracks app usage in the background using Android's Accessibility Service
3. **Automatic Blocking**: When the time limit is reached, KidLock automatically blocks access to apps
4. **Access Codes**: Generate temporary access codes to grant additional time when needed
5. **Admin Control**: Parents can access settings and override blocks using the secure PIN
